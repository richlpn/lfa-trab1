;;; There are 4 dialects of the language Clirc (CIRC): AON, IZO, NAND and NOR.
;;; The only difference between then is the set of predefined functions that
;;; they recognize:
;;;
;;; - AON: and, or, not
;;; - IZO: if, zero, one
;;; - NAND: nand
;;; - NOR: nor
;;;
;;; So there is a general function called `eval-prog`, that evaluates program in
;;; all dialects. This function receives as first argument, a map with the
;;; predefined functions. Each predefined function will be defined by a symbol
;;; -- the name of the function -- as key, and a record (map) with keys for the
;;; `:arity` (number of arguments) of the function and the `:body` of the
;;; function.

  The syntax of the assignment is `(set! lhs rhs)`, where `lhs` stands for
  *left hand side*, and `rhs` stands for *right hand side*. The `lhs` can be
  a variable (symbol) or the output. The `rhs` is a function call. See also
  [[eval-funcall]].

  - `input` is an array of zeros and ones making the input of the program.

  The function will return a map with the output generatde by the execution
  of `prog` for the given `input` values. Only the output indexes that have
  been assigned values in `prog` will be present in the output map.
